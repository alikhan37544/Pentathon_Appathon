                    <p>The student correctly described the basic process of photosynthesis and its importance, though some details are omitted. They mention sunlight, carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen, which are accurate components, but they don't specify glucose as a product or explain how carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere.
