                    <p>- The student identified global warming as an effect, which is a minor point of focus in their answer. They touched on it correctly.

- Only listed two potential causes but missed important ones like deforestation and industrial processes.
- The mention of penguins dying was more specific than needed, sticking too closely to the incorrect cause.

The student's answer is somewhat correct but needs refinement to avoid confusion between causes and effects and to include all relevant factors.</p>

                    <p>The industrial revolution happened directly after the french revolution. It was basically where urbanization, factory products and change in labour practices. it made lots more products go big boom. Also, it resulted in class barriers and socio economic problems for everyone. Child labour, domicile, global warming happened and earth suffered while humans thrived. Mass market things became good and small market things were killed.</p>

                    <p>The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the Industrial Revolution's causes and effects, though some inaccuracies exist. They correctly identify urbanization, factory-based economies, and changes in labor practices as key factors. However, their mention of global warming is incorrect; the term "global warming" wasn't coined until later. The answer lacks specific details on how these changes affected socioeconomic structures, such as labor migration or class dynamics.</p>
