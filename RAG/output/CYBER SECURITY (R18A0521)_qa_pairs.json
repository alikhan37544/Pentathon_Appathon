        "question": "What are some limitations of focusing solely on the CIA Triad concept of availability?",
        "answer": "Availability \nThis is the final component of the CIA Triad and refers to the actual availability of your data. Authentication mechanisms, access channels and systems all have to work properly for the \ninformation they protect and ensure it's available when it is needed. Understanding the CIA triad \nThe CIA Triad is all about information. While this is considered the core factor of the \nmajority of IT security, it promotes a limited view of the security that ignores other important \nfactors. For example, even though availability may serve to make sure you don't lose access to \nresources needed to provide information when it is needed, thinking about information \nsecurity in itself doesn't guarantee that someone else hasn't used your hardware resources \nwithout authorization."

    {
        "question": "What types of computer network attacks involve overwhelming targets with more traffic than they can handle?",
        "answer": "In a denial of service (DoS) attack, users are deprived of access to a network or web \nresource. This is generally accomplished by overwhelming the target with more traffic than it \ncan handle. In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) exploit, large numbers of compromised systems \n(sometimes called a botnet or zombie army) attack a single target.
